            \item Problem Analysis
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item There is no app that deals with both administrative work and attendance system, these both are managed separately.
                \item There are only apps that allow teachers to mark a student's attendance manually.
                \item In any case, if the student's attendance can not be marked, there is no alternate way to mark it.
            \end{enumerate}
            \item Method of solution
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item The problem of managing both, i.e., the administrative work and student's attendance, together can be resolved by creating a single platform.
                \item The problem of attendance marking can be resolved by allowing both, i.e., the teacher as well as the student to mark the student's attendance.
            \end{enumerate}
