\hspace{1cm}As a college administrator, it is my job to manage the working of the college. I want a system that can help in easing my management work. I want to manage all the batch related information at one place, including the courses in that batch, the subjects, the students, the faculties, and can register and view the student's attendance. everything. The system should also provide the office staff and faculty with some functionalities. For office staff, they can manage batch related information too, i.e., batch's courses and students, and can register and view the student's attendance. For faculties, they view syllabus, their lecture schedules, and can register and view the student's attendance. One more thing I want is a separate system for the students to mark their attendance and view their course related information. And everyone should have their own login id and passwords to access the system.
